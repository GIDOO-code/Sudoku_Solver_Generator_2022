		<H2>The force algorithm is a logical solution.<br>
			It's not an absurd algorithm.</h2>
	<p>	All of the Force-based algorithms use the current (extended)link.
		The chain is assembled using this links, and the truth or false of the cell candidate is logically derived.<br><br>
		The Force algorithm is based on the following logic.
		<ol>
			<li>Set X has one element true and the rest false. Which is true is undecided.</li>
			<li>In a chain starting with true element, the value of the derived element is determined to be true or false.</li>
			<li>In a chain starting with false element, the value of the derived element is uncertain (it can be true or false).</li>
			<li>For each chain that starts assuming each element of set Ⅹ as true, 
				the authenticity of element A is determined 
				when the true/false values ​​of element A leading by all chains match.
			<li>In the chain that starts assuming that one element B of set X is true,
				when the true/false values ​​of the element C guided by multiple routes do not match,
				the starting element B is determined to be false.</li>
		</ol>
	
		Set X is specifically rows, columns, blocks, and cells, as follows:<br><br>
		<img src="images/img56/Force_set.png"><br>

		The (extended) link and chain structure of the Force method is relatively simple.<br>
		It is also an efficient analysis method. That is, a good analytical algorithm.<br>

	<h2>ForceChain</h2>
		<p>ForceChain is an analysis algorithm that uses <a href="page28.html">super link</a>.
		The algorithm uses a spillover search rather than a chain search that repeats trials such as NiceLoop.
		This site uses <a href="http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/index.php"> HoDoKu </a> as a reference.
		There, ForceChain is on "Last Resort" page.
		It is certain that ForceChain is an extremely powerful analysis algorithm.
		However, i do not know if there is a problem that can only be solved with ForceChain.<br>
		SuperLinkMan/Eval_SuperLinkChainEx used in this algorithm is a powerful routine.
		With specify the origin cell/digit, and type Strong/Weak of the first link, 
		all links are found.<br>
		There is C # source code in the project.
		</p>

		<p>(1)ForceChain_Cell</p>
		<p>
		Focused one uncertain cell A. Even if any of the candidate digits of cell A is assumed to be true, 
		when the digit#n of cell B to be linked becomes true, In B cell #n is determined to be true.<br>
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style1"><img src="images/img56/img56aEng.png" alt="ForceChain_Cell"></p>
		
		<p>When following the link assuming that the candidate digit#a is true, 
		some digit in the cell may lead to both true and false.
		This is the case of (3)ForceChain_Contradiction below,
		 the first proposition "#a is true" is an error,
		Therefore, there is no link starting with "#a is true".
		In the GNPX implementation, this case is not included in the solution of ForceChain_Cell,
		but is solved by ForceChain_Contradiction.</p>
			
		<p>An example of ForceChain_Cell. Cell r2c4 becomes #1 even if the digit in cell r4c4 is #3 or #7.
		The link string at this time is shown.<br>
